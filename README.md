# LethalData v1.0 by Reese72

First and foremost I want to give plenty of credit and many thanks to [Artemis64](https://github.com/Artemis6425) for developing LethalTracker, which I shamelessly used as a source of heavy inspiration for LethalData's UI.

The main goal of this program is to take everything about [Lethal Tracker](https://github.com/Artemis6425/LethalTracker) that was fantastic and make it better, while adding features where they were lacking.
That said, many parts of LethalData isn't a complete clone of [Lethal Tracker](https://github.com/Artemis6425/LethalTracker). For one, LethalData has no OBS mode, nor does it have any of the quota pace calculations 
which make [Lethal Tracker](https://github.com/Artemis6425/LethalTracker) better for Q1, Q3, etc... runs, so if either of those are important to you it would be best to stick with the OG.

## Features

- All-inclusive multi-quota tracker for keeping tabs on loot, player deaths, sells, quota rolls, and more
- Built-in sell calculator that accounts for overtime (Finding the terminal value for a given amount of scrap coming soon)
- Automatic quota roll calculation 
- Save and Load to file (slightly bugged as of v1.0, but useable)
- Per-Quota average and profit (may have forgotten overall and Q2+ average in v1.0, so get hyped for v1.1)
- Plenty of other feature and UI improvement in the works


## Known issues

- The above mentioned bug in the save/load system causes the program to only save the data from quotas that have been scrolled away from. Therefore, until v1.1 is ready, the workaround is simply to scroll through all the quotas before saving.
- If [Artemis64](https://github.com/Artemis6425) thought the code for LethalTracker was "fairly messy", she's never seen anything quite like the code I conconct out of laziness. I may make the code cleaner, but if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
