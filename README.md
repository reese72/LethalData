# LethalData by Reese72

First and foremost I want to give plenty of credit and many thanks to [Artemis64](https://github.com/Artemis6425) for developing LethalTracker, which I shamelessly used as a source of heavy inspiration for LethalData's UI.

The main goal of this program is to take everything about [Lethal Tracker](https://github.com/Artemis6425/LethalTracker) that was fantastic and make it better, while adding features where they were lacking.
That said, LethalData isn't a complete clone of [Lethal Tracker](https://github.com/Artemis6425/LethalTracker). For one, LethalData has no OBS mode, nor does it have any of the quota pace calculations, so if either of those are deal breakers it would be best to stick with the OG.

## Features

- All-inclusive multi-quota tracker for keeping tabs on loot, player deaths, sells, quota rolls, and more
- Built-in sell calculator that accounts for overtime
- Specifiable player names and notes for detailed logging
- Top and Bottom line loot for each day
- Automatic quota roll calculation 
- Save and Load to file
- Per-Quota average and profit
- Overall average and ship loot
- Plenty of other feature and UI improvements in the works


## Known issues

- The code for v1.1 is pretty bad. I may try to clean it up, but if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
